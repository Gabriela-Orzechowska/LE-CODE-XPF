# LE-CODE XPF
This repo contains a C++ implementation of LE-CODE's Extended Presence Flags behaviour. <br>
https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Extended_presence_flags

## Unimplemented conditions:
- 200cc
- Item Rain
- &gt;12 players
  
These all conditions can be added by the developer if needed adjusting to their codebase.

This code uses (outdated) game documentation from Melg: <br>
